# PWM-Controller-Design-and-Memory-Mapped-Integration-with-RISC-V-ET1035-SoC
PWM Controller Design and Integration with RISC-V ET1035 SoC using Port Mapping. Designed a reusable Verilog PWM, verified on FPGA, and mapped to memory for duty-cycle updates via C code. Enabled LED brightness and DC motor speed control through hardwareâ€“software co-design.
